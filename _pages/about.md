I am a Machine Learning Master's student at KTH Royal Institute of Technology. I worked on linear mode connectivity in neural loss landscapes as part of my Master's thesis at [RPL](https://www.kth.se/is/rpl) supervised by [Prof. Josephine Sullivan](https://www.csc.kth.se/~sullivan/). Before that, I did my Bachelor's at Indian Institute of Technology Madras, India, and spent a few years at Robert Bosch as a Software Engineer.

 I am interested in understanding how and why modern learning methods work as well as they do. I wish to work towards establishing the scientific foundations of machine learning, particularly deep learning, by rethinking conventional wisdom, and revisiting the choices that have set the context of contemporary systems.

You can find my CV [here](files\adhithyan_CV.pdf), and my Master's thesis report [here](files\Adhithyan_Kalaivanan_thesis_report_draft.pdf).
