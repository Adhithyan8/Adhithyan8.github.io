<div style="text-align: justify;">
I am a Machine Learning Master's student at KTH Royal Institute of Technology. I am working on linear mode connectivity in neural loss landscapes as part of my Master's thesis at <a href="https://www.kth.se/is/rpl">RPL</a> [RPL](https://www.kth.se/is/rpl) supervised by [Prof. Josephine Sullivan](https://www.csc.kth.se/~sullivan/). Before that, I did my Bachelor's at Indian Institute of Technology Madras, India. I also spent some time at Robert Bosch as a Software Engineer.

I have a broad interest in researching the theoretical foundations of machine learning, with an inclination towards understanding the mathematical underpinnings of deep learning and the generalization of neural networks. I aim to establish the limitations and provide guarantees for both methods used in developing and interpreting ML models and the models themselves. I firmly believe that questioning, re-examining, and debunking the folk wisdom within the research community, and uncovering not just the implicit biases of models but also the assumptions and design choices made at a system level, are essential steps toward understanding and improving this technology. I hope to be part of thoughtful research endeavors that embody this approach.
