I am a Machine Learning Master student at KTH Royal Institute of Technology. I am working on linear mode connectivity in neural networks as part of my Master's thesis at [RPL](https://www.kth.se/is/rpl) supervised by [Josephine Sullivan](https://www.csc.kth.se/~sullivan/). Before that, I did my Bachelor's at Indian Institute of Technology Madras, India. I also spent some time at Robert Bosch as a Software Engineer.

My research interests are in the area of Deep Learning, specifically in the areas of Neural Network Generalization, Neural Network Compression and Neural Network Interpretability. I am also interested in the intersection of Deep Learning and Optimization. I am currently looking for PhD positions in these areas.

You can find my CV [here](files\adhithyan_CV.pdf), and my Master's thesis report [here](files\Adhithyan_Kalaivanan_thesis_report_DRAFT.pdf).
