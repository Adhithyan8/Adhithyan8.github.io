I am a PhD student at the Division of Statistics and Machine Learning (STIMA), Linköping University, working at the intersection of generative modelling and computational statistics.  I am supervised by [Senior Assoc. Prof. Fredrik Lindsten](https://liu.se/medarbetare/freli29) and co-supervised by [Asst. Prof. Jens Sjölund](https://jsjol.github.io/) and [Asst. Prof. Zheng Zhao](https://zz.zabemon.com/). I am an affiliated PhD-student within the [WASP](https://wasp-sweden.org/) program.

My current research focuses on leveraging diffusion and flow based models to solve statistical problems like sampling and Bayesian posterior inference. And inversely, I am also interested in using inference methods to improve training, fine-tuning and test time performance of flow based generative models. Though my primary focus is methodological, I am particularly excited about applications in materials discovery, molecular design, and protein generation.

I completed my Masters degree in Machine Learning from KTH Royal Institute of Technology. My master thesis on the linear mode connectivity in neural networks can be found [here](https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:1835931)
