I am a Research Engineer at KTH Royal Institute of Technology working on indentification of novel plankton species from images under [Prof. Josephine Sullivan](https://www.csc.kth.se/~sullivan/). I worked on linear mode connectivity in neural loss landscapes as part of my Master's thesis at [RPL](https://www.kth.se/is/rpl). Before that, I did my Bachelor's at Indian Institute of Technology Madras, India, and spent a few years at Robert Bosch as a Software Engineer.

 I am interested in understanding how and why modern learning methods work as well as they do. I wish to work towards establishing the scientific foundations of machine learning, particularly deep learning.

You can find my CV [here](files\adhithyan_CV.pdf), and my Master's thesis report [here](files\Adhithyan_Kalaivanan_thesis_report_draft.pdf).
